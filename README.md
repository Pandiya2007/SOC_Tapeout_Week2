<summary><h2> What is a System on a Chip (SoC)?</h2> </summary>


<p align="center"><img src="./ASSETS/1.png" width="700" alt="image 1"/></p>

A **System on a Chip (SoC)** is like fitting an entire computer onto a single microchip. Instead of using many separate components like CPU, memory, input/output controllers, graphics, and connectivity chips, an SoC packs most (or all) of them into one compact silicon chip. This makes devices smaller, faster, and more power efficient‚Äîperfect for smartphones, wearables, smart appliances, and even cars.
